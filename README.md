## 💻 Project

Well, since I have to create a lot of new projects with pretty much the same configs, I decided to save a bit of my time.

If you are starting and don't know how to create a project on your own and config eslint, prettier, editorconfig I highly recommend you to give a try. But don't forget, look it up to know what's going on here. 😉

The project was initialised using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
